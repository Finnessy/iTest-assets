# Spirent Automation Assets Warehouse

Welcome to the Spirent Automation Assets Warehouse. You will find a wide variety of automation assets useful for your iTest projects and/or Velocity deployments. All are available for immediate download and use. This warehouse contains a selection of projects useful for gaining the greatest value from your test equipment, devices, and frameworks. The assets are rich in reusable QuickCall libraries and response maps, key capabilities that will help you create your own automation most efficiently.

The assets are categorized into three levels of maturity/testing:
- Certified:  provided and tested by Spirent
- Reference:  provided by Spirent with intent to serve as “blueprint” on structure and usage
- Community:  submitted by community or Spirent personnel with no review by Spirent       

You are encouraged to submit your projects back to the Warehouse for others to benefit from.
