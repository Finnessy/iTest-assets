    <td style="border: 0px solid black;">This portion of the Warehouse contains a selection of iTest projects. They are useful for gaining the greatest value from your test equipment, devices, and frameworks. The assets are rich in reusable QuickCall libraries and Response Maps.  Both are key capabilities that will help you create your own automation most efficiently.  They will help you whether or not you are using Python or an Automation framework (e.g., Robot).</td>
